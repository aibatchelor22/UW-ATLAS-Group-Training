# UW-ATLAS-Group-Training
A collection of code for Monte Carlo siumlations for particle physics (more specifically, the the Large Hadron Collider) for analyzing products of particle collisions.  

The code includes several sections

-Generating random distributions based on probability density functions and displaying histograms of the data

-Generating a 2D parton shower (stochastic splitting of unstable particles)

-Generating a 3D parton shower (stochastic splitting of unstable particles)

-Clustering algorithms on parton showers to identify particle jets

-Pseudomass calculations of particle jets
